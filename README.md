# react-jira-d3
A library for displaying graphs from Jira, for example bug count over time  
or other things. This library is still a work in progress and is likely to  
change quite a bit.

## Goal
Since JIRA cloud has only a limited Graph library, and the usage is quite limited  
sometimes. I had the idea to use D3.js and make a library that can be embedded onto  
a website where people can use easy to use React components to display the information  
they need. Rather that paying for a plugin that could be very expensive.  

I am pretty sure that there are libraries outthere already, and frankly I did not bother in  
looking at the npmjs repo to see if someone already did that.  

I am doing this because I want to learn D3.js and to boost my knowledge of React.


## Future
In the future I want to add libraries for other frontend frameworks, like Angular or VueJS.
Right now this is my freetime project, and I try to work on it as much as possible.

No promises though :D
